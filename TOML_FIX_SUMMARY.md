# ✅ TOML Syntax Error Fixed

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The Netlify deployment was failing with the error:
```
Could not parse configuration file Can't redefine existing key at row 11, col 19, pos 219
```

## 🔧 Root Cause
The `netlify.toml` file had a duplicate key definition in the `[build]` section:

**Before (Incorrect):**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "18" }  # ❌ First definition

[build.environment]  # ❌ Second definition - conflict!
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  VITE_ENVIRONMENT = "development"
```

## ✅ Solution Applied
Fixed by consolidating the environment variables into a single `[build.environment]` section:

**After (Correct):**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  VITE_ENVIRONMENT = "development"
```

## 🧹 Additional Cleanup
- Simplified headers syntax for better readability
- Removed redundant comments
- Ensured proper TOML array syntax for `[[headers]]` sections

## ✅ Verification Results
- ✅ TOML syntax is now valid
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ All configuration files present
- ✅ Environment variables properly set
- ✅ Ready for Netlify deployment

## 🚀 Current Status
The `netlify.toml` file is now syntactically correct and ready for deployment. The configuration includes:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: 18
- **Environment**: `VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://dev.kaha.com.np/hostel/api/v1`
- **SPA Routing**: Configured
- **Security Headers**: Applied
- **Caching**: Optimized

## 📝 Key Learnings
1. **TOML Syntax**: Cannot define the same key twice in different ways
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `[build.environment]` section for all build-time variables
3. **Headers Arrays**: `[[headers]]` syntax is correct for multiple header rules
4. **Validation**: Always test configuration before deployment

The deployment should now work successfully on Netlify! 🎉
