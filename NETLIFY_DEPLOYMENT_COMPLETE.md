## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Prepare deployment
npm run deploy:prepare

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add Netlify deployment configuration"
git push origin main

# 3. Connect to Netlify
# - Go to netlify.com
# - Click "New site from Git"
# - Connect your repository
# - Netlify auto-detects netlify.toml configuration
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Deploy dist folder
# - Go to netlify.com
# - Drag and drop the 'dist' folder
```
