## Test Infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **Testing Library**: @testing-library/react
- **Mocking**: vi.mock for hooks and external dependencies
- **Setup**: Comprehensive mock setup for API calls and context providers
- **Coverage**: Unit tests focusing on component behavior and user interactions

## Notes
- All tests follow React Testing Library best practices
- Tests focus on user behavior rather than implementation details
- Comprehensive mocking of hooks and external dependencies
- Error states and loading states are properly tested
- Form validation and user interactions are thoroughly covered
- Tests verify the removal of deprecated features (UUID visibility, average monthly booking metric)

## Next Steps
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Add integration tests for complete workflows
- Consider adding visual regression tests
- Monitor test coverage metrics
- Update tests as components evolve
