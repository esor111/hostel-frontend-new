  {charge.type === 'monthly' && 
    <span className="text-blue-600"> • Daily: ₹{Math.round(charge.amount / 30)}</span>
  }
</p>
```

## 📊 Complete Billing Flow

### **1. Student Enrollment (Mid-Month)**
```
Day 15 Enrollment → Calculate remaining 16 days → Prorate monthly charges
Example: ₹9,000/month × 16 days ÷ 30 days = ₹4,800 (prorated)
```

### **2. Monthly Billing (1st of Month)**
```
Auto-generate invoices → Full monthly charges → Send Kaha App notifications
Example: ₹9,000/month (full amount for complete month)
```

### **3. Mid-Month Checkout**
```
Day 20 Checkout → Calculate 10 unused days → Refund prorated amount
Example: ₹9,000/month × 10 days ÷ 30 days = ₹3,000 (refund)
