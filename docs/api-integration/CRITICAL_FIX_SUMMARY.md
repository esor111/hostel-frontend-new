# Critical Fix Summary - StudentManagement Component

## 🚨 **Issue Encountered**
During the Ledger Module integration, the StudentManagement component was corrupted during an IDE autofix operation, resulting in:
- **Runtime Error**: `ReferenceError: students is not defined`
- **Empty File**: The component file became empty/corrupted
- **Application Crash**: The entire Student Management section was non-functional

## ✅ **Resolution Applied**
**Immediate Action Taken:**
1. **Identified the Issue**: Component file was corrupted during autofix
2. **Restored Component**: Recreated the complete StudentManagement component with proper API integration
3. **Verified Fix**: Successful build and functionality restoration

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### What Was Restored:
```typescript
// Complete StudentManagement component with:
