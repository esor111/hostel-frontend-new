├── schedulerService.js         ✅ Scheduling operations
└── studentService.js           ✅ Student management
```

**✅ VALIDATION:**
- Each domain has its own service file
- Services handle all data operations
- Services return data from JSON files
- Proper separation of concerns maintained

---

## 3️⃣ UI IMPLEMENTATION RULES - ✅ COMPLIANT

### 🎨 Component Data Usage Pattern
**✅ CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION:**
```javascript
// Example from StudentManagement.tsx
const { state, refreshAllData } = useAppContext();
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");

// Data fetched through services, not hardcoded
const filteredStudents = state.students.filter(student => 
  student.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
);

return filteredStudents.map(student => (
  <div key={student.id}>
    <h3>{student.name}</h3> {/* Data from service, not hardcoded */}
    <p>{student.roomNumber}</p>
  </div>
));
```

**✅ VALIDATION:**
- NO hardcoded data directly in JSX
- ALL data fetched through services and mapped in components
- Proper React patterns: useEffect + useState for data fetching
- Components consume data through proper state management

---

## 4️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION ORDER - ✅ COMPLIANT

### 📋 Implementation Sequence Verified
1. **✅ First: JSON Mock Data Files Created**
   - All domain entities have corresponding JSON files
   - Realistic data structure with proper relationships
   - Comprehensive sample data for testing

2. **✅ Second: Service Layer Functions Created**
   - Complete CRUD operations for each domain
   - Proper async/await patterns
   - Promise-based return values

3. **✅ Third: UI Components Built**
   - Components consume services properly
   - No direct data hardcoding
   - Proper state management integration

4. **✅ Fourth: User Actions Implemented**
   - All actions go through services
   - Proper error handling
   - Consistent data flow patterns

---

## 5️⃣ DATA CONSISTENCY - ✅ COMPLIANT

### 🔄 Single Source of Truth Validation

| Data Type | Service | Components Using | Consistency |
|-----------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Students | studentService.js | StudentManagement, Dashboard, Ledger | ✅ Consistent |
| Rooms | roomService.js | RoomManagement, StudentManagement | ✅ Consistent |
| Invoices | invoiceService.js | InvoiceManagement, BillingDashboard | ✅ Consistent |
| Payments | paymentService.js | PaymentRecording, Dashboard | ✅ Consistent |
| Ledger | ledgerService.js | StudentLedgerView, Dashboard | ✅ Consistent |
| Discounts | discountService.js | DiscountManagement, Reports | ✅ Consistent |

**✅ VALIDATION:**
- All pages/components showing same data type use same service
- Single source of truth maintained through services
- Services are the only place where data manipulation occurs

---

## 6️⃣ FUTURE API READINESS - ✅ COMPLIANT

### 🚀 API Transition Readiness Assessment

**✅ SERVICE STRUCTURE EXAMPLES:**
```javascript
// Current mock implementation - easily convertible to API
export const studentService = {
  async getStudents() {
    // Current: return mock data
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve([...studentsData]), 100);
    });
    
    // Future API: just change implementation
    // return fetch('/api/students').then(res => res.json());
  },
  
  async createStudent(studentData) {
    // Current: mock creation
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      const newStudent = { id: generateId(), ...studentData };
      studentsData.push(newStudent);
      resolve(newStudent);
    });
    
    // Future API: just change implementation
    // return fetch('/api/students', {
    //   method: 'POST',
    //   body: JSON.stringify(studentData)
    // }).then(res => res.json());
  }
};
```

**✅ VALIDATION:**
- Services structured for easy API conversion
- Consistent async/await patterns throughout
- All service methods return promises
- Clean separation between data layer and UI layer
