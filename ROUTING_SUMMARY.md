# Landing Page Routing - Quick Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### What Was Done

1. **Separated Public and Protected Routes**
   - Landing page (`/`) is now publicly accessible
   - Login page (`/login`) is publicly accessible
   - All admin routes require authentication

2. **Updated Navigation Flow**
   - Landing page → Login page → Business Selection → Admin Dashboard
   - "Hostel Owner Login" button now navigates to `/login`
   - Added "Back to Home" button on login page

3. **Smart Redirects**
   - After login, users are redirected to their intended destination
   - If accessing protected route while logged out, redirected to login
   - After login, automatically returned to the originally requested page

4. **Files Modified**
   - `src/App.tsx` - Route structure with public/protected separation
   - `src/pages/Landing.tsx` - Updated login button navigation
   - `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Added back button and redirect logic
   - `src/pages/BusinessSelection.tsx` - Added redirect after business selection
   - `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` - Updated to redirect instead of render

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Landing Page**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173/`
   - Should see the landing page without login

3. **Test Login Flow**:
   - Click "Hostel Owner Login"
   - Should navigate to `/login`
   - Login with demo credentials
   - Should show business selection
   - Select a business
   - Should redirect to `/admin`

4. **Test Protected Routes**:
   - Logout
   - Try to visit `http://localhost:5173/admin`
   - Should redirect to `/login`
   - After login, should return to `/admin`
