## Data Architecture Compliance

All JSON files follow the data architecture requirements:

### ✅ Realistic API Structure
- Each record has proper ID fields
- Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) included
- Status fields for state management
- Proper relationships between entities

### ✅ Comprehensive Field Coverage
- All form fields from UI components are represented
- Additional metadata fields for business logic
- Proper data types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
- Validation-ready structure

### ✅ Relationship Mapping
- Student-Room relationships via roomNumber/roomId
- Student-Payment relationships via studentId
- Student-Invoice relationships via studentId
- Student-Charges relationships via studentId
- Room-Dimensions relationships via roomId

### ✅ Business Logic Support
- Status tracking for all entities
- Financial calculations (balances, refunds)
- Audit trails (createdBy, processedBy, approvedBy)
- Date tracking for due dates, payment dates, etc.

## Next Steps for Database Implementation

1. **Service Layer Creation**: Create corresponding service files for each JSON data file
2. **API Integration**: Structure allows easy conversion to API endpoints
3. **Validation Rules**: Implement validation based on required fields and data types
4. **Relationship Constraints**: Implement foreign key relationships in actual database
5. **Indexing Strategy**: Plan indexes for frequently queried fields (studentId, roomId, dates)

## File Locations
All JSON files are created in `src/data/` directory:
- `demoRequests.json`
- `hostelProfiles.json`
- `students.json`
- `roomConfigurations.json`
- `roomDimensions.json`
- `studentCharges.json`
- `payments.json`
- `invoices.json`
- `checkouts.json`
- `systemSettings.json`

This comprehensive data structure provides a solid foundation for implementing the database layer while maintaining consistency with the existing UI forms and business requirements.
